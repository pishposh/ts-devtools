<p>IE (thru 9) won't display this.</p>

<!-- The presence of this comment causes IE≤9 to ignore everything between
     the declaration of x in the script block and the second closing script
     tag; remove the comment, or even just its close tag (causing a runaway
     comment in other browsers), and all is well in IE≤9. IE10 parsing
     matches other browsers. -->

<p>This either.</p>

<p>But after the spurious script close tag, finally, life.</p>
